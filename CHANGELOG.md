### Migration Guide

To maintain the previous behavior, update your `config/images.php`:

```php
'routes' => [
    'prefix' => 'img',  // Keep old prefix
],
'cache' => [
    'path' => 'cache/img',  // Keep old cache path
],
```

For new installations, no changes needed - `/glide/` is the new default.
