## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-05

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Changed default route prefix from `/img/` to `/glide/`** to avoid conflicts with other packages

- Cache directory changed from `cache/img` to `cache/glide`

### Added

- Added `UPGRADE.md` file with migration instructions
- Added `TESTING.md` file with compatibility testing guide
- Added better configuration documentation in README

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Default route prefix changed from `img` to `glide`
- **BREAKING:** Default cache path changed from `cache/img` to `cache/glide`
- Updated all hardcoded `/img/` references to use dynamic configuration
- Updated documentation examples to use new `/glide/` prefix
- Improved ServiceProvider with better tags for publishing

### Fixed

- Fixed route conflicts when used alongside `laravel-dropzone-enhanced`
- Fixed cache path configuration to be dynamic instead of hardcoded
- Fixed fallback image URLs to use configurable prefix

### Migration Guide

To maintain the previous behavior, update your `config/images.php`:

```php
'routes' => [
    'prefix' => 'img',  // Keep old prefix
],
'cache' => [
    'path' => 'cache/img',  // Keep old cache path
],
```

For new installations, no changes needed - `/glide/` is the new default.
